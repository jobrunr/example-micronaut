# JobRunr Micronaut example

This repository shows an example how you can integrate [JobRunr](https://www.jobrunr.io) and [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/).

## About this project
### Micronaut and JobRunr integration
To integrate JobRunr into Micronaut:
- just add the dependency: `org.jobrunr:jobrunr-micronaut-feature:LATEST`
- make sure that you configure JobRunr in the micronaut `application.yml`
```yaml
jobrunr:
  job-scheduler:
    enabled: true
  background-job-server:
    enabled: true
  dashboard:
    enabled: true
```
- JobRunr will automatically find the correct [StorageProvider](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/installation/storage/).

### Package structure
This project has the following packages:
- **org.jobrunr.examples**: this package contains the application class that bootstraps the Micronaut app.
